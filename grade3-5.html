      Ah yes, the stage where curiosity EXPLODES! 💥 You ask a million questions, and sometimes even the teachers pause to think 😆. Fractions, multiplication, and long essays are starting to creep in, but your brains are ready for the challenge. Friendships get deeper, jokes get sillier, and suddenly, recess feels like the best part of the day — but don’t let the chaos distract you from learning. Mistakes are just plot twists in your epic adventure called school. Keep exploring, keep asking, keep discovering — because curiosity is your superpower, and it’s going to take you places you can’t even imagine yet 🌟.

        HOW TO STUDY PROPERLY?
        <br></br>
         Study in a way that makes you qualified to teach others the same topic.
         You can try explaining the topic to an imaginary person, or a stuffed toy.
         If you explained and taught them the topic well, that means you have MASTERED THE TOPIC!!
